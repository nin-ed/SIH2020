# SIH 2020
## Real time land usage monitoring tool using satellite data and artificial intelligence (P.S: NS275)
### Team Name- Shooting Stars

Our idea is to develop a crop monitoring system which doesnâ€™t require any manual effort and eliminating the middlemen and the corruption while selling the yields. We will also act as a bridge between farmers and government so that government could help the farmers in need as quickly as possible.<br>Farmers can use the platform to monitor weather conditions for minimizing related risks, plan and 
       manage field works to prevent losses. Vegetation Indices will be used for analysis of the field and 
       related information will be displayed for proper decision making and act as a supportive 
       mechanism for yield prediction.<br>Insurers will be able to extract historical information about the field vegetation, climate/ weather 
       data, and assess land usage without visiting these fields as these can be easily monitored directly 
       from the platform.<br>Both the website and mobile app will be bilingual i.e. English and Hindi so that both the it would be 
       suitable for all the farmers.
